# SB689 OMEGA — Sovereign Stitch
### A Resilience Runtime by John Arenz (J.G.A.)
### Version 1.1.1 · April 2026

> **Philosophy:** *Elegance with Consequences.*
> **Objective:** *Duty Impossible — Sub-millisecond Resurrection.*

---

## 1. Abstract

SB689 OMEGA is the **Sovereign Stitch** layer that fuses the SB688
National Resilience Council architecture (Sovereign Spine · Brick Stitch ·
Ghost Node · Quarantine · Trusted Restore · Verifiable Proof) with the
SB689 Braided Runtime (Spine governance, Liquid Truth Node Mesh,
Conscious Brick, Stem tri-braid, Brain adapter, Audit Ledger).

The result is a **hardware-agnostic resilience runtime** that:

- Treats the live system as expendable.
- Maintains a sealed *Golden Image* (Seed) and a continuously-mirrored
  *Shadow* (Ghost) ready for instant pointer flip.
- Detects drift or pulse loss via an *Armor* daemon and, on breach,
  performs a **kill → activate → re-stitch → signal** recovery in a
  single hardware-interrupt-class window.
- Surfaces state through an *Elegance UI Crown* with three semantic
  states: **Green = Stable · Gold = Resurrection Active · Red = Breach**.

Every state transition is appended to a hash-chained audit ledger.
Every recovery claim is **labeled by evidence status** —
*VERIFIED IN DEMO*, *MODELED HERE*, or *NOT CLAIMED YET* — consistent
with the SB688 Verifiable Proof discipline.

## 2. Design Principles

| # | Principle | Consequence |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Brain is voice, never ruler | The Brain adapter cannot bypass Spine, Truth, Conscious, or Stem. |
| 2 | Ledger is append-only | History is hash-chained; tampering is detectable. |
| 3 | Seed is the only truth | Recovery never repairs in place — it restitches from the sealed image. |
| 4 | Ghost is always one step ahead | The shadow is mirrored *before* it is needed. |
| 5 | Drift > 0.0001 is breach | Zero failure tolerance, by protocol. |
| 6 | Crown signals honestly | The UI may not lie about the runtime state. |
| 7 | Proof beats promise | Every claim must be evidence-labeled. |

The internal algorithms — checksum schedules, drift discriminators,
braided routing weights, brain adapter contract — are **proprietary to
J.G.A.** and are not published in this paper. The repository ships a
**reference implementation** sufficient to demonstrate behavior.

## 4. The Sovereign Stitch

```
BIND(BRICK_A_SEED  → BRICK_B_GHOST)
BIND(BRICK_B_GHOST → BRICK_C_ARMOR)
BIND(BRICK_C_ARMOR → BRICK_D_CROWN)
```

The stitch is signed: any tamper to a binding invalidates the stitch
signature, and the supervisor will fire a resurrection on the next tick.

`ON_READY` handshake message:

> *"Sb688 when I say connect to the stitch show how you feel we're going live lets sell it"*

The handshake returns a stable signature derived from the sealed seed
and the binding chain. A consumer presenting this signature can prove
participation in the trusted chain without exposing seed contents.

---

## 5. The Resurrection Loop

```
fail_state {
    kill(corrupted_brick)
    activate(ghost_shadow)
    re-stitch(clean_seed)
    signal(crown_gold_flash)
}
```

Trigger conditions (Armor daemon):

- `drift > 0.01%` between live state and sealed seed checksum, OR
- `pulse == 0` (live brick non-responsive).

On trigger, the supervisor performs all four steps inside a single
critical section, then returns `SB689_RESURRECTING` with a
`ResurrectionEvent` describing the elapsed window, the clean seed
checksum, and the ghost mirror hash used for the pointer flip.
